## 🛡️ Putting It All Together

**Room:** [Putting It All Together — TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/room/puttingitalltogether)  
**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Date:** *(24 April 2025)*

### 🎯 Objective  
This room brought together everything covered so far — from DNS and HTTP to WAFs and load balancers — to show how a full web request flows through the stack.  
The goal was to understand each component’s role in serving a webpage securely and efficiently.

### 🗝️ Key Concepts  
- DNS – Translates domain names into IP addresses so browsers can find websites.  
- HTTP – The protocol used to send and receive web content between browsers and servers.  
- Load balancers – Distribute traffic across servers to balance load and prevent crashes.  
- CDNs – Store and deliver content from edge servers closer to users for faster performance.  
- WAFs – Sit between users and web servers to filter malicious requests.  
- Web servers – Respond to requests with web content like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
- Virtual hosting – Lets a single server handle multiple websites using different domain names.

---

### 🛠️ Tools Used  
- Browser DevTools — Used to inspect HTTP requests and understand headers.  
- Network flow diagrams — Helped visualise the journey of a web request.

---

### ⚠️ Challenges Faced  
- Initially struggled to picture how all the pieces fit together from DNS to WAF.  
- Mapping out the full request path helped connect the dots and made everything click.

---

### 🧠 What I Learned  
- Understood how DNS, load balancers, CDNs, and WAFs all play a role in modern websites.  
- Learned how each layer improves speed, reliability, and security.  
- Realised the complexity behind what looks like a simple web page load.

### 🌐 Real-World Application:  
> Understanding this flow is crucial for securing and troubleshooting real web infrastructure.  
> From pen testing to setting up secure web apps, knowing how the full stack works makes it easier to spot issues and defend against attacks.

### 💭 Reflections:  
- This room really tied everything together — it was satisfying seeing the full picture.  
- The big takeaway: even simple websites have a lot going on behind the scenes.
